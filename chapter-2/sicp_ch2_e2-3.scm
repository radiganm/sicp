;;; Exercise 2.3. Implement a representation for rectangles in a plane. (Hint: You may want to make use
;;; of exercise 2.2.) In terms of your constructors and selectors, create procedures that compute the
;;; perimeter and the area of a given rectangle. Now implement a different representation for rectangles.
;;; Can you design your system with suitable abstraction barriers, so that the same perimeter and area
;;; procedures will work using either representation?
