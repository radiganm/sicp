            \subsubsection{Deductive Information Retrieval}
Exercise 4.55.  Give simple queries that retrieve the following information from the data base:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item all people supervised by Ben Bitdiddle;
\item the names and jobs of all people in the accounting division;
\item the names and addresses of all people who live in Slumerville.
\end{enumerate}

              \outlist{../output/sicp_ch4_e4-55.out}
Exercise 4.56.  Formulate compound queries that retrieve the following information:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item the names of all people who are supervised by Ben Bitdiddle, together with their addresses;
\item all people whose salary is less than Ben Bitdiddle's, together with their salary and Ben Bitdiddle's salary;
\item all people who are supervised by someone who is not in the computer division, together with the supervisor's name and job.
\end{enumerate}
